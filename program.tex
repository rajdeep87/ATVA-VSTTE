\section{Program Model}~\label{pmodel}
%
Let $Prog$ be a program. Let $Var$ be the set of variables in the program $Prog$
and let $Val$ be the set of values that each variable can take and may be a 
scalar number in set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ or set of rationals
$\mathbb{Q}$ or reals $\mathbb{R}$.
%
We consider \emph{programs} with bounded loops and finite recursion depth 
along with safety properties given as a set of assertions, $\assertions$, 
in the program.  All the loop bounds in the program are known apriori. 
All functions calls in the program are inlined before analysis.  
%We also support pointers.  \rmcmt{other program model supported}.
%
\section{Semantic Representations of Program}
%
The \emph{concrete semantics} of a program is the most precise mathematical
description of the program behavior. Any other semantic representation of a
program obtained through static analysis such as {\emph{data-flow
analysis}~\cite{flow-book} or \emph{set-constraint}~\cite{Cousot:1995} 
based analysis, is an abstract semantics which is derived from the concrete 
semantics via Galois connections. 


Several semantic representation~\cite{Cousot04,semantic02} of a program have been proposed
in the literature to analyze program properties.  Cousot~\cite{Cousot04} defines
a hierarchy of abstraction semantics of a state transition system $M$ corresponding to a 
control-flow graph $G$.  Cousot starts from partial trace semantics and derive successive
approximations via Galois connection which follows the sequence -- a) \emph{partial 
trace semantic}, b) \emph{reflexive transitive closure semantic}, 
c) \emph{reachability semantic}, d) \emph{interval semantic}. Each semantic 
representation differ from the other in the precision of the information.  An 
abstract semantics is less precise than their concrete counterparts and hence 
can prove less program properties, but are cheaper to compute or approximate.  
Cousot in~\cite{semantic02} gives a complete range of abstract semantics of a program.
%


\para{Partial Trace Semantics}
%
The semantics of a program computes the \emph{states} of a program which gives a
concise mathematical meaning of a program.  The collecting semantics of a
program computes all possible memory states that can occur during the execution
of a program.
%
Recall that a trace $\pi$ of a state transition system $M=(\Sigma, \mathcal{R},
\mathcal{I})$ is a finite sequence of states that follows the transition
relation $\mathcal{R}$.  Let $\Sigma_{M}^n$ denote the set of finite execution 
traces of length $n$. Then, $\Sigma_M^0=\emptyset$, while  
$\Sigma_M^1=\{s \mid s\in \Sigma\}$. 
Further, a trace of length $(n+1)$ can be expressed recursively as 
$\Sigma_M^{(n+1)}=\{\sigma ss' \mid \sigma s\in \Sigma_{M}^n \wedge (s,s') \in
\mathcal{R}\}$.   
%


%Thus, a \emph{concrete semantics}~\cite{Cousot04} of a program is the set of all finite 
%execution traces, 
We will denote the \emph{partial trace semantics} as $(\llbracket M \rrbracket_{t})$ 
which is powerset of traces, $(\powerset(\Pi), \subseteq)$.  
%
A fixed point characterization of the trace semantics is defined as follows. 
%
\[
  \mathit{lfp}\; F_{M}^{t}\; \text{where}\; F_{M}^{t}(X) \mathrel{\hat=} \{s \mid s \in
  \Sigma\} \cup \{\sigma ss' \mid \sigma s \in X \wedge (s,s') \in \mathcal{R} \}
\]
%
\para{Collecting Semantics over Traces}
%
The collecting semantics~\cite{Cousot04} of $M$, $\Sigma_{M}^{*}$, 
is the set of all such finite execution traces of transition system $M$, and is given by 
$\Sigma_M^*\mathrel{\hat=} \bigcup_{n\geq0}\Sigma_M^{n}$. 
%
%
\para{Reachability Semantics}
%
%Whereas, Min\'{e}~\cite{minepaper} starts from 
A \emph{reachability} semantics~\cite{minethesis} of a state transition 
system $M=(\Sigma, \mathcal{R},\mathcal{I})$ is the set of states that are 
reachable from the initial states $\mathcal{I}$. A reachability
semantics is a complete lattice of powerset of
states defined as, $(\powerset(V \times (Var \rightarrow Value)), \subseteq,
\cup, \cap)$ and is denoted by $(\llbracket M \rrbracket_{r})$. 
%
A fixed point characterization of the reachability semantics is
defined as follows.
\[
  \mathit{lfp}\; F_M^{r}\; \text{where}\; F_{M}^{r}(S) \mathrel{\hat=} \mathcal{I} \cup \{s' \mid
   \exists s \in S \wedge (s,s') \in \mathcal{R} \} 
\]
%
Cousot in~\cite{Cousot04} shows that a reachability semantics can be derived
from a partial trace semantics through a sequence of abstractions.  Thus, 
the trace semantics $\llbracket M \rrbracket_{t}$ is more precise than the 
reachability semantics $\llbracket M \rrbracket_{r}$.  However, it is
practically infeasible to compute the trace semantics of a program 
that finds all memory states which occur during a program execution.

\section{Trace Transformers and CFG Safety}
%
The semantics of a state transition system $M$ corresponding to a control-flow graph
$G$ can be defined in terms of \emph{state semantics}~\cite{Cousot04} or \emph{trace
semantics}~\cite{Cousot04}.  Informally, a state semantics $(\llbracket M \rrbracket_{s})$ 
or reachable semantics defines the reachable states of $M$ starting from an initial state.  
Whereas, a trace semantics $(\llbracket M \rrbracket_{t})$ of $M$ is the set of well-formed 
traces of $M$. 
%
In section~\ref{state-transformer}, we define various classical 
\emph{state transformers} of $M=(\Sigma, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{I})$ 
that operates over the powerset of states, $\mathcal{P}(\Sigma)$.
%
We now define various trace transformers that operates over $\powerset(\Pi)$ 
and formulate \emph{CFG safety} in terms of these transformers. The term
$\sigma_i \in \Sigma$ refers to a state and $\pi \in \Pi$ ranges over a set of 
traces in $\Sigma^*$. 
%
\para{Strongest Postcondition} A \emph{strongest postcondition}
  transformer, $tpost(T)$, of a set of traces $T \subseteq \Pi$ is defined as  
  $tpost(T) \mathrel{\hat=} \{\pi.\sigma_l \mid \exists \pi \in \Pi.\; \pi \in T
  \wedge \{\sigma_a \ldots \sigma_k\} \in \pi \wedge \sigma_k \rightarrow \sigma_l\}$. 
  The term $\pi.\sigma_l$ denotes extending trace $\pi$ with its postcondition
  state $\sigma_l$.\\
%
\para{Weakest Precondition} A \emph{weakest precondition}
  transformer, $\widehat{tpre(T)}$, of a set of traces $T \subseteq \Pi$ is defined as  
  $\widehat{tpre(T)} \mathrel{\hat=} 
  \{\sigma_b\pi \mid \forall \sigma_a \in \Sigma.
  \sigma_a\sigma_b\pi \in T \vee \sigma_a \not\rightarrow
  \sigma_b \}$. \\
%
\para{Existential Precondition} An \emph{existential precondition}
  transformer, $tpre(T)$, of a set of traces $T \subseteq \Pi$ is defined as  
  $tpre(T) \mathrel{\hat=} \{\sigma_a.\pi \mid \exists \pi \in \Pi.\; \pi \in T
  \wedge \pi = \{\sigma_b \ldots \sigma_k\} \wedge \sigma_a \rightarrow
  \sigma_b\}$. 
  The term $\sigma_a.\pi$ denotes extending trace $\pi$ with its precondition
  state $\sigma_a$.\\
%
\para{Universal Postcondition} An \emph{universal postcondition}
  transformer, $\widehat{tpost(T)}$, of a set of traces $T \subseteq \Pi$ is defined as  
  $\widehat{tpost(T)} \mathrel{\hat=}
  \{\pi\sigma_k  \mid \forall \sigma_l \in \Sigma.
  \pi\sigma_k\sigma_l \in T \vee \sigma_k \not\rightarrow
  \sigma_l \}$. 
%
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\para{CFG Safety}  
%
Let $G = (V, E, \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{T}, I, E)$ 
  be a CFG with a special error node $\err \in V$.  A trace $\pi
  \in G$ is safe if it does not terminate in the error location. A CFG $G$ is
  \emph{safe} w.r.t. $\err$ if all traces $\pi$ of $G$ are safe
  w.r.t $\err$.
%
We define two trace transformers over $\powerset(\Pi)$ for safety checking of a
CFG, an unsafe trace transformer, $f_{unsafe}$, and a safe trace transformer,
$f_{safe}$. A CFG $G$ is \emph{safe} exactly if $f_{unsafe}^{G}(\Pi)=\emptyset$.
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:unsafe}
f_{unsafe}^{G}(T) \mathrel{\hat=} \{\pi \in \Pi \mid \pi \in T \wedge
\pi\;\text{ is well formed and not safe} \} 
\end{equation}
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:safe}
f_{safe}^{G}(T) \mathrel{\hat=} \{\pi \in \Pi \mid \pi \in T \vee \pi\;
\text{is not well formed or safe} \} 
\end{equation}
%
\para{Fixed-point Characterization of Unsafe Trace Transformer} 
%
We present a fixed point characterization of the unsafe safe transformer for
counterexample search and conflict generalization. A counterexample search 
corresponds to finding an abstract representation of a counterexample trace 
over $\powerset(\Pi)$. 
%
Let $\chi$ denote the set of states $\{(v,\omega)\mid v = \err \}$ that 
are at the error location.  Then, the unsafe trace transformer of CFG $G$, can 
be characterised as follows.
%
\begin{proposition}
%
  $f_{unsafe}^{G}(T) = T \cap (\mathit{lfp}\; Z.\;\mathcal{I} \cup tpost(Z)) \cap 
    (\mathit{lfp}\; Z.\;\chi \cup tpre(Z))$
%
\end{proposition}
%
\begin{proof}
  The fixed point characterization of unsafe trace transformer is described as
  follows. 
  Let $C1  = (lfp Z.\;\mathcal{I} \cup tpost(Z))$ and $C2 = (lfp Z.\; \chi \cup
  tpre(Z))$. The set $C1$ gives set of traces that starts from an initial
  state $\mathcal{I}$ and follows the transition relation $\mathcal{R}$.  
  The set $C2$ gives the set of traces that follows the transition relation 
  and terminates in an error state.  The set $C1 \cap C2$ is the set of 
  well-formed traces that terminates in an error state. It follows 
  that $f_{unsafe}^{G}(T) = T \cap C1 \cap C2$.  
\end{proof}
%
Note that the two fixed points above, for computing $C1$ and $C2$, represents a
forward and backward analysis respectively. Combination of forward and backward
analysis provide strictly greater precision than applying either in
isolation~\cite{Cousot99} in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% TRACE SEMANTICS APPROXIMATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Approximations of Trace Semantics}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:semantic} shows the sequence of syntactic translation steps 
and semantic approximations of concrete set of traces, $\powerset(\Pi)$.  
A program is represented by a Control-flow Graph $G=(V,E,S,\mathcal{T},I,E)$.  
Classical abstract interpretation interprets a CFG as equation 
system~\cite{minethesis,Schmidt98,tacas12}, which is described next.  The box in 
\emph{red} shows the corresponding lattices that an abstract interpreter
operates on.  The ACDLP procedure presented in this paper operates on a
different lattice which is obtained by syntactic translation step
$\mathcal{T}_2$ that translates a CFG to SSA form. The bounded box in 
\emph{green} shows the corresponding lattices for ACDLP. In this section, 
we first describe an equation system that is derived from a CFG which is commonly
used for abstract interpretation.  Later, we describe a syntactic translation 
of CFG to Static Single Assignment form which is used for ACDLP procedure.   
In section~\ref{semantic-trace}, we desribe the corresponding lattices over 
these structures and various transformers to operate on these lattices.

%
\subsection{CFG to Constraint System}~\label{ssa-cite}
%
Recall that an operational semantics of a CFG can be defined using a 
state transition system. An equation 
system can be derived from a state transition system, which introduces a set
values varaible $(S_v)_{v \in V}$ to each program location that takes values in
powerset of environments, $\powerset(Var \mapsto Value)$.  These equations perform 
point-wise lifting of $\powerset(Var \mapsto Value)$ to $V$.   The variables $S_v$
are related through the transformers associated with program statements that express the 
data-flow equations between individual control-flow nodes in the CFG.  Haller
et. al. call this equation system~\cite{minethesis} 
\emph{static analysis equation}~\cite{tacas12}.  Solution to these equations 
yields the data-flow information of $G$.  The resulting lattice that describes 
these static analysis equations is given by $(\mathcal{F}_G, \sqsubseteq)$.   
%


Figure~\ref{fig:se} gives the CFG representation of a program (in left) 
and its corresponding static analysis equations (in right).  The 
function $post(S)$ computes the successor state of a set of states 
$S$ that can be reached in one step.  A set-valued variable $S_v$ is 
introduced at every control location $v$ in the CFG.  Note that the variables
$S_v$ are related through the post-condition transformer $post$ associated with
the program statements, for example, the variable $S_{n6}$ at the loop head
merges the control-flow from $S_{n5}$ and $S_{n7}$.  The CFG is \emph{safe} if
$S_{Error}$ is empty $(\emptyset)$. 
%

A collecting semantics over static analysis equations of a program gathers for 
each program variables and program location its value during program execution.

\subsection{Logical Encoding of Program Semantics}~\label{ssa-cite}
%
\para{Program Transformation $\mathcal{T}_2$}
%
The program transformation $\mathcal{T}_2$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:semantic}
involves two separate steps. 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generation of a \emph{bounded program}
  \item Translation of acyclic control-flow of bounded program to SSA
\end{enumerate}
%
\para{Generation of Bounded Program}
%
A \emph{bounded program} is obtained from an input program by a transformation 
that unfolds loops and recursions a finite number of times, which generates an
acyclic control-flow structure.  Figure~\ref{fig:unwind} and figure~\ref{fig:unwind-cfg} 
gives an input program and the corresponding bounded program obtained through
loop unrolling, respectively.
%

\caption{Generating Bounded Program throug loop unrolling
  \label{fig:unwind-cfg}}
\end{figure}
%
The CFG representation of the bounded program is 
translated to a Static Single Assignment (SSA) form 
%through the syntactic translation step, $\mathcal{T}_2$, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:semantic}.  
The translation from CFG to SSA is a well known technique 
in optimizing compiler and verification~\cite{ssa1,ssa2,ssa1988,ssa1991}.  We 
briefly explain the details of the CFG to SSA translation since this is standard. 
%
\para{CFG to Static Single Assignment Form}
%
The translation from CFG to SSA follows two separate steps.  
The first step gives a unique \emph{index} to each
definition of a program variable, and each use of that variable is given the
index of the definition that reaches it; the second step insert special 
$\phi$-functions at control-flow join points where a given variable may have
more than one reaching definition.  The argument to a $\phi$-function is the 
set of all indexed instance of the variable that could reach the join point.
Based on the current execution trace, the $\phi$-function select an appropriate
instance of the variable and assign it to a new instance of the variable. The
translation involves the following steps. 
%
\begin{enumerate}
\item A unique name for each definition point in the procedure, shown in
  figure~\ref{fig:ssa-simple}. 
\item Identifies points in the procedure that merges different values from
  distinct control-flow paths, shown in figure~\ref{fig:ssa-simple}  
\item Identification of induction variables in loops becomes easy by inserting a
  $\phi$-function for any variable that is modified inside the
    loop~\cite{Gerlek:1995}.
\end{enumerate}

%
\para{Collecting semantics over SSA}
%
A collecting semantics over SSA of a bounded (loop free) program gathers for each 
SSA variables its value during program execution.
%
\para{Advantages of SSA}
%
Previous researches have shown that Static Single Assignment form has
advantages over other forms of programs representation which allows compilers to
facilitate program analysis through simplification of data-flow analysis such as
def-use and use-def chains and design of optimization
algorithms~\cite{ssa1991,ssa1,ssa2}. 
%
\para{Exact SSA semantics} An SSA semantics is \emph{exact} if it is
constructed from a bounded program.  Recall that a bounded program is 
obtained through \emph{complete} unwindings of all loops and recursions, which
gives an acyclic code.  
Therefore, for acyclic code, an SSA exactly represents the strongest 
post-condition computation of the code.
The lattice that describe these SSA constraints over SSA 
variables is given by $(\mathcal{SA}_G, \subseteq_{SA})$.  
%
%Chapter~\ref{six} gives the \emph{exact}, \emph{overapproximate} and \emph{underapproximate} SSA semantics for an input program. 
%
In this paper,  we restrict our formalizations to bounded programs which 
gives an exact SSA semantics of a program.  
%
\para{SSA Safety}
%
The translation from CFG to SSA is represented by a set 
$\constraints=\program\cup\{\neg \bigwedge_{\assertion\in\assertions} \assertion\}$,
where $\program$ contains an encoding of the statements in the program as
constraints, obtained after translating the program into single static 
assignment (SSA) form~\cite{ssa88,ssa1988,ssa1991}. 
%
Based on the above program representation, we define a \textit{safety formula}
($\formula$) as the conjunction of all elements in $\constraints$, that is,  
$\formula:= \bigwedge_{\constraint\in\constraints} \constraint$.  The formula 
$\formula$ is unsatisfiable if and only if the program is safe.
\rmcmt{Intuitively, $\formula$ is the usual SAT encodings of BMC for
reachability.} 
%
\begin{example}
The safety formula $\formula$ for the bounded program of 
figure~\ref{fig:unwind-ssa} is shown below.  Note that $\formula$ is obtained
by taking conjunction of all SSA and the negation of set of assertions. 
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ssa}
\begin{array}{l}
  \formula = (x_0 = 0) \wedge
     (x_0 \leq 2) \wedge
     (x_1 = x_0 + 1) \wedge
     (x_1 \leq 2) \wedge
     (x_2 = x_1 + 1) \wedge
     ((x_1 > 2) \vee (x_2 > 2)) 
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\end{example}

%
Recall that $(\powerset(\Pi),\subseteq)$ and $(\mathcal{SA}_G, \subseteq_{SA})$ 
forms a \emph{concretization-based galois connection} through a concretization
operator $\gamma_T$, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:lattice}. Cousot and Cousot in
~\cite{CC92} propose a relaxation of galois connection framework that allows to work
only with a concretization operator $\gamma$ or dually an abstraction operator
$\alpha$.  We will use this concept to establish the relationship between 
$(\powerset(\Pi),\subseteq)$ and $(\mathcal{SA}_G, \subseteq_{SA})$ only through a 
concretization operator, $\gamma_T$.  Figure~\ref{fig:syn-map} illustrates that 
$\gamma_{T}$ can be achieved through the syntactic back-translation steps, 
$\mathcal{T}_1'$ and $\mathcal{T}_2'$.  
%
\para{Program Transformation $\mathcal{T}_2'$}
%
The program transformation $\mathcal{T}_2'$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:syn-map}
involves two separate steps. 
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Copy-insertion~\cite{Srikant:2007} to remove $\phi$-nodes. 
  \item \rmcmt{Variable renaming in each basic blocks}
\end{enumerate}
%
The translation of SSA to an original program following these syntactic translation
steps is a well known technique in compiler-based code
optimization~\cite{Briggs:1998,ssa1991,Srikant:2007}.
Briggs et. al.~\cite{Briggs:1998} give an algorithm for translation of SSA 
to the original program by replacing $\phi$-functions with appropriately-placed
\emph{copy} instructions.  The program semantics is preserved by inserting a 
copy statement for each argument of $\phi$-function, at the end of each 
predecessor block of the $\phi$-node. Figure~\ref{sp} shows an example of copy
insertion to replace $\phi$-function in SSA.  We skip the details of the translation 
from SSA back to original program since this is standard and beyond the scope of 
this paper.

$\gamma_T$ is automatically monotonic since $\gamma_T(A) = \pi$, where $A \in
  \mathcal{SA}_G$ is an exact abstraction of $\pi \in \Pi$.  That is, 
  $(\mathcal{SA}_G, \subseteq_{SA})$ is an exact abstraction of

containing SSA constraints corresponds to an unsafe trace (or counterexample) 
of the original program.  Later, we present a procedure for finding a satisfiable
assignment of $\formula$ in section~\ref{acdlp}.  Note that the model of
$\formula$ contains concrete assignments to SSA variables, which has to be
mapped back to the original program.}
