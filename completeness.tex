Termination discussion with Leopold
===================================
Termination —
acyclicity ,
progress in finite case — finite lattice explore the whole lattice
gamma-complete counterexample —
Leopold POPL paper terminatation argument follow for finite lattice — progress finitely many steps — there is infinite sequence — guarantee of widening is finite — cannot go infinitely for in the lattice — width of the lattice — buckjump in the lattice can not reach same search same infinitely
When I step down in lattice, given a decision operator that does not infinitely make decisions — infinite intervals — smart decision operator makes finite range over intervals, either leads to conflict or gamma-complete in finite number of steps

    no infinite sequence of decisions
    no infinitely buckjump
    d when decide, b when backtrack — there is no sequence of algorithm that generate infinite sequence of b and d alternate — as long as we don’t reach some same space in lattice, hence not cyclic
    either an interval is unsat, or there is one value wherein is satisfiable
    — bounded from above intervals

case 2: For infinite lattice
— SSA variables are finite, SSA values are finite
